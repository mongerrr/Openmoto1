# OpenMoto Trials Name Board

The files in this folder can be used to 3D print a front name board for a trials bike. They are held on by cable ties around the front forks, and feature a set of loops to hold a pen and a bar clip a scorecard to, for when competing in a club trial. The geometry of the part will suit any preprinted graphics made for a Honda CRF50 2013+ template

If you have any suggestions, feedback, or pictures of your 3D print, feel free to post it using the "Issues" link above

## Instructions
### Instructions For Printing
If you would just like to 3d print this part, use the "name_board_final.stl" file. If you don't have your own 3D printer, I would recommend using 3dhubs.com, as you can get good quality prints for a reasonable price.

If you would like someone else to organise the printing and materials for you, please contact me at [amonger@gmail.com](mailto:amonger@gmail.com) and I can arrange that for you for a small fee ($5 or 10% of the printing price, whichever is greater). A variety of materials can be printed including, PLA, ABS, Polycarbonate, Carbon Fibre and others.

*In the coming weeks, I will add some comments about materials I have tried. I currently have an ABS plastic piece, and I am currently waiting on copies in PLA and Carbon Fibre*

### Instructions For Modification
If you think you would like to make some improvements to the design, feel free to make changes!
To do this;
- Use the download link to get all the files in this folder
- Extract the files from the zip folder
- Open "name_board_build.scad" using [Openscad](http://www.openscad.org/)
- Once you have made your changes, export the model as an stl
- To make the stl ready to print, use a tool like [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to clean up any irregularities in the stl file

A 3d print of the part showing the front and back. I will go into detail on this in a post on my blog. This one was printed in 2 parts and has a visible seam.

## About OpenMoto
In the future, I do intend on creating more designs for a variety of bikes including trials, mx, enduro and roadbikes. I also intend for these designs to be distributed freely, with the option for people to get me to organise 3D printing for a small fee. For this model and more new designs, visit [mongerrr.github.io](mongerrr.github.io)

If yo would like to become a collaborator and share your designs alongside me, contact me at [amonger@gmail.com](mailto:amonger@gmail.com)

If you would like to support the design of parts like these, please make a donation, however big or small at [paypal.me/mongerrr](paypal.me/mongerrr)
